# ProjectTracker
 Final project for SoftUni C# learning path.
------------------------

The idea of the application is pretty simple.
Project Tracker is an application that helps manage the work process in working business environment.
Everything is organized by Departments, Projects and Employees.
Users can submit tickets(tasks) to projects, track current tasks' progress and view overall info for a given Project and Department.

I got inspired to choose this type of application to be my final project by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CoderFoundry">Coder Foundry</a>.
This was one of my main sources of studiying materials along with SoftUni, Tim Corey and many many more since the begining of my C# journey.
